## Git Workflow
- Always create a working branch using format: `<type>/<scope>-<short-desc>`.
- Use concise, conventional commit messages.
- Open a Pull Request for completed changes instead of pushing directly to `master`.
- In each PR description, include:
  - summary of changes,
  - affected files/components,
  - notable decisions or caveats.
- PR body must be valid Markdown with real line breaks.
- Do not use escaped newline sequences (`\n`) or unnecessary escaping in PR text.
